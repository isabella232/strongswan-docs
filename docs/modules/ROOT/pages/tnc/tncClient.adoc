:IETF:    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html
:RFC5998: {IETF}/rfc5998

== Installation

In order to run a TNC client communicating via PT-EAP, in addition to the standard
strongSwan VPN configuration the following
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] options have to be enabled

 --enable-eap-identity --enable-eap-ttls --enable-eap-tnc --enable-tnccs-20 --enable-tnc-imc

If client authentication is based on passwords instead of X.509 certificates,
additionally either the EAP-MD5 or EAP-MSCHAPv2 methods have to be enabled with
`--enable-eap-md5` or `--enable-eap-mschapv2`, respectively.

== Configuration

In the xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] configuration file a
couple of important parameters have to been set:
----
charon {
  plugins {
    eap-ttls {
      max_message_count = 0
    }
    eap-tnc {
      max_message_count = 0
    }
    tnccs-20 {
      max_batch_size   = 32754
      max_message_size = 32722
    }
  }
}
----

=== Message Size Restrictions

Since often quite a lot of messages are exchanged via the PT-EAP transport protocol
protected by EAP-TTLS, the default upper limit set by the `*max_message_count*`
parameter of the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_eap_tnc[`*eap-tnc*`] and
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_eap_ttls[`*eap-ttls*`] plugins
have to be disabled in order not to disrupt the communication.

It is also recommended to set the maximum PB-TNC batch size and the maximum
PA-TNC message size possible with PT-EAP transport to the
xref:tnc/optimumTncSizes.adoc[optimum values] defined above.

=== Restriction of TLS Cipher Suites

It is possible to restrict the TLS cipher suites proposed by the client
in a xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_libtls[`*libtls*`] section of
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
----
libtls
{
  suites = TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
}

== Integrity Measurement Collectors

Any number of Integrity Measurement Collectors (IMCs) can be attached to a TNC Client.
An IMC is a dynamic library which communicates with the TNC Client via the
{IFIMC}[TNC IF-IMC] API defined in the form of a C header file. The `*/etc/tnc_config*`
file tells the TNC Client which IMCs are to be loaded:
----
#IMC-Configuration

IMC "OS"             /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imc-os.so
IMC "Scanner"        /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imc-scanner.so
# IMC "SWIMA"        /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imc-swima.so
# IMC "Attestation"  /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imc-attestation.so
----
In the configuration file above, the `*OS IMC*` and the `*Scanner IMC*` are enabled, so
that these Integrity Measurement Collectors have to be built beforehand with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] options

  --enable-imc-os --enable-imc-scanner

When the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon starts up, the IMCs are loaded.
`*IMC 1 OS*` and `*IMC 2 Scanner*` subcribe to the standard PA-TNC message subtypes
`*Operating System*` and `*Firewall*` defined in the `*IETF*` namespace, respectively.

}

    id = hacker
    secret = K8FW9/N0VIAJ
  }
}
----
Two configuration variants are possible. The first that is currently enabled uses
certificate-based EAP client authentication whereas the second alternative that is
currently commented out is based on a preshared EAP secret. In the following we
are going to discuss both variants.

xref:tnc/tncServer.adoc#_tnc_enabled_vpn_server_configuration[TNC Server] >

== Certificate-Based EAP Client Authentication

The client authentication is based on an EAP Identity defined by

 eap_id = client.strongswan.org

as enabled in the configuration xref:#_tnc_enabled_vpn_client_configuration[above],
matched by an X.509 client certificate that is going to be used in the initial TLS
handshake of the EAP-TTLS method.

The xref:swanctl/swanctlListConns.adoc[`*swanctl --list-conns*`] shows the loaded
VPN connection definition
----

    remote: 10.1.0.0/16 192.168.0.2/32

=== IKEv2 Connection Setup

The IPsec connection is started as usual with the
xref:swanctl/swanctlInitiate.adoc[`*swanctl --initiate*`] command
----
# swanctl --initiate --child tnc > /dev/null
07[CFG] vici initiate CHILD_SA 'tnc'

08[NET] sending packet: from 192.168.0.3[500] to 192.168.0.2[500] (240 bytes)
----
Since no IKE client identity has been explicitly defined, the client's IP
address `*192.168.0.3*` is used by default. By sending the EAP_ONLY notify, the
client is signalling to the server that it is willing to accept *EAP-only*
authentication according to {RFC5998}[RFC5998]

09[NET] sending packet: from 192.168.0.3[4500] to 192.168.0.2[4500] (272 bytes)
----
Since the VPN client didn't include an AUTH payload in its IKE_AUTH request, the
VPN server switches to EAP-based authentication and at the outset requests an EAP
Identity. The client replies with its EAP Identity `*client.strongswan.org*`.
Due to the *EAP-only* mode, the server doesn't include an AUTH payload in its
first IKE_AUTH response, either.

Now within the EAP-TTLS tunnel the PT-EAP transport protocol is started and the

A PB-TNC Result batch is received by the TNC client. It contains a PA-TNC message
of standard subtype `*Operating System*` directed to the `*OS IMC*` and carries
a standard `*Assessment Result*` PA-TNC attribute with the value `*compliant*`.

Additionally the PB-TNC Result batch contains the three standard PB-TNC messages
of standard types `*PB-Assessment-Result*`, `*PB-Access-Recommendation*`, and
`*PB-Reason-String*` with the values `*non-compliant minor*`, `*Access Denied*`
and `*Open server ports were detected*`, respectively.

Finally the TNC client sends a PB-TNC Close batch to the TNC server, closing

Since the overall PB-TNC `*PB-Assessment-Recommendation*` was `*Access Denied*`
due to the open TCP server port, the IKEv2 negotiation aborts as well. The PB-TNC
Connection `*1*` is removed and the states of the `*OS IMC*` and `*Scanner IMC*`

== PSK-Based EAP Client Authentication

Alternatively a preshared EAP secret could be used with EAP-MD5 or EAP-MSCHAPv2
within EAP-TTLS by enabling the EAP Identity

  eap_id = hacker

in the configuration file xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] defined
xref:#_tnc_enabled_vpn_client_configuration[above] and then reloading the edited
configuration with the xref:swanctl/swanctlLoadConns.adoc[`*swanctl --load-conns*`]
command. The xref:swanctl/swanctlListConns.adoc[`*swanctl --list-conns*`] then
shows the reloaded VPN connection definition

address `*192.168.0.3*` is used by default. By sending the EAP_ONLY notify the

Since the VPN client didn't include an AUTH payload in its IKE_AUTH request, the
VPN server switches to EAP-based authentication and at the outset requests an EAP
Identity. The client replies with its EAP Identity `*hacker*`. Due to the *EAP-only*
mode, the server doesn't include an AUTH payload in its first IKE_AUTH response,
either.
