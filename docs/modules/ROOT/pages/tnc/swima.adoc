== Software Identification Tags

A `*Software Inventory*` consists of all software packages currently installed on
an endpoint and is usually described using {SWIDTAG}[ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 SWID Tags]
of the form:

----
The SWID tag shown above describes version `*5.0-6ubuntu1.1*` of the `*Ubuntu 20.04*`
software package `*bash*` for the `*x86_64*` architecture. The tag optionally
contains `SHA-2` file hashes that can be used as reference values for remote
attestation. The unique tag identifier is `*Ubuntu_20.04-x86_64-bash-5.0-6ubuntu1.1*`.

== Software Inventory Attributes

The Software Inventory Message and Attributes (SWIMA) for PA-TNC
({RFC8412}[RFC 8412]) standard is an extension of {RFC5792}[RFC 5792] and defines
in the IETF namespace a new SWIMA Attributes PA-TNC message subtype and the
following new PA-TNC attributes
----
- SWIMA Request
- Software Inventory
- Software Identifier Inventory
- Software Events
- Software Identifier Events
- Subscription Status Request
- Subscription Status Response
- Source Metadata Request
- Source Metadata Response
----
By sending a `*SWIMA Request*` attribute, a
xref:./swimaServer.adoc#_swima_imv[`*SWIMA IMV*`] can request from a
xref:./swimaClient.adoc#_swima_imc[`*SWIMA IMC*`] either a complete `*Software
Inventory*` consisting of SWID tags or a more compact `*Software Identifier
Inventory*` made of the tag identifiers, only. Alternatively `*Software Events*`
or `*Software Identifier Events*` can be requested. It is also possible to
establish `*Subscriptions*` which obliges a
xref:./swimaClient.adoc#_swima_imc[`*SWIMA IMC*`] to immediately send changes in
the `*Software Inventory*` or new `*Software Events*` to the
xref:./swimaServer.adoc#_swima_imv[`*SWIMA IMV*`] as soon as they occur.

== Software Inventory Client

There are two ways how the strongSwan
xref:./swimaClient.adoc[Software Inventory Client] functionality can be used to
determine the current state of the software inventory on an endpoint:

* Collocated with a strongSwan VPN client (Network Access Requestor) running a
  xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon that communicates over IKEv2 EAP
  ({RFC7171}[PT-EAP]).

* The stand-alone xref:./pt-tls-client.adoc[`*pt-tls-client*`] communicating
  over TLS ({RFC6876}[PT-TLS]).

In both cases the xref:./swimaClient.adoc#_swima_imc[`*SWIMA IMC*`] is required
to manage the software inventory measurements on the TNC client.

== Software Inventory Server

There are two ways how the strongSwan
xref:./swimaServer.adoc[Software Inventory Server] functionality can can be used
to manage the software inventory of associated endpoints:

* Collocated with a strongSwan VPN gateway (Policy Enforcement Point) running a
  xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon that communicates over IKEv2 EAP
  ({RFC7171}[PT-EAP]).

* A stand-alone strongSwan Policy Decision Point (PDP) based on a skeleton
  xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon with the `*tnc-pdp*` plugin
  communicating either over TLS ({RFC6876}[PT-TLS]) or RADIUS ({IFPEP}[IF-PEP]).

In both cases the xref:./swimaServer.adoc#_swima_imv[`*SWIMA IMV*`] is required
to manage the software inventory measurements on the TNC server.

=== Software Tag ID Policy

In order to collect *Software Identifiers* of all software packages installed on
the associated enpoints, we define a *SWID Tag IDs* policy enforcement for the
*Default* group in the xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC] policy manager tool.

.*SWID Tag IDs* Policy Enforcement for the *Default* Group
image::swidTagIdPolicy.png[Software Tag ID Policy, link=self]

=== Software Identifier Collection

When the *TNC Client* connects to the home network for the first time the
current state of the *`Software Inventory*` in the form of `*Software Events*` is
requested

.Successful Collection of Software Identifier Inventory
image::swidReport.png[Software ID Collection Report, link=self]

We see that currently 176 software packages are installed on the *TNC Client*
endpoint. When we click on the *Most recent session* we see the session details

.Software ID Collection Session
image::swidSession.png[Software ID Collection Session, link=self]

In the session 395 `*Software Identifier Events*` and 111 *SWID Tags* were
collected.

=== Software Events View

When we scroll down in the device report for the *TNC Client*, we see a list of
collected `*Software Events*`.

.Software Events
image::swidEvents.png[Software Events, link=self]

These `*Software Events*` are time-stamped. Let's select the ones from
`*Feb 17 02:18:54 2021*`

.Software Event Details
image::swidEventDetails.png[Software Event Details, link=self]

The event details show the update of the three `*Ubuntu 20.04*` packages `*apt*`,
`*base-files*` and `*bash*` on `*Feb 17 02:18:54 2021*`.

=== SWID Tag View

When we click on the `*Ubuntu_20.04-x86_64-bash-5.0-6ubuntu1.1*` tag ID of the
freshly installed `*bash*` package, we see the details of its SWID tag

.SWID Tag Details of Version 5.0-6ubuntu1.1 of the Ubuntu 20.04 *bash* Package
image::swidUbuntuBashTag.png[Ubuntu 20.04 bash SWID Tag, link=self]

When we press the blue button the raw XML-encoded SWID tag is shown

.Raw XML-encoded SWID Tag of the Ubuntu 20.04 bash Package
image::swidUbuntuBashRawTag.png[Ubuntu 20.04 raw bash SWID Tag, link=self]

=== File Information View

Each SWID tag contains a complete list of the files contained in the software
packages including the path where the file is going to be installed in the file
system of the endpoint. When we click on the `*/bin/bash*` file we see the file
details

.Details of the /bin/bash File
image::swidFileBash.png[Details of the /bin/bash File, link=self]

We see that the `SHA-256` hash of the file has been extracted from the SWID tag
and can be used as a reference value for *Remote Attestation*.

=== Package View

When we click on the `*bash*` package name we see what versions of this package
have been registered up to now

.Details of the /bin/bash File
image::swidPackageBash.png[Details of the /bin/bash File, link=self]

=== Security Updates

The xref:./swimaServer.adoc#_security_updater[`*sec-updater*`] tool is periodically
run to get security updates from the Debian, Ubuntu and Raspian websites.
After such a security update the device report of the `*TNC Client*` shows the
that `*25*` vulnerable software packages have been detected

.Device Report after Security Updater Run
image::swidVulnerabilityReport.png[Device Report after Security Updater Run, link=self]

At the bottom of the device report the versions of the vulnerable software packages
that are installed on the device are listed

.Vulnerable Software Package Versions
image::swidVulnerablePackages.png[Vulnerable Software Package Versions, link=self]

=== Updated Package Information

The xref:./swimaServer.adoc#_security_updater[`*sec-updater*`] tool automatically
generates SWID tags for the updated software package that fix a vulnerability.
Thus due to the following `*bash*` {BASHSEC}[vulnerability] the Ubuntu 20.04
package has been updated

.Vulnerable bash Package Versions
image::swidPackagesBash.png[Vulnerable bash Package Versions, link=self]

Of course the `SHA-2` file hashes of the updated software package are also available
