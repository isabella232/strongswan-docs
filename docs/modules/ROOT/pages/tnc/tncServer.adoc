== Installation

In order to run a TNC server communicating via PT-EAP, in addition to the standard
strongSwan VPN configuration the following
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] options have to be enabled

 --enable-eap-identity --enable-eap-ttls --enable-eap-tnc --enable-tnccs-20 --enable-tnc-imv --enable-sqlite

If client authentication is based on passwords instead of X.509 certificates,
additionally either the EAP-MD5 or EAP-MSCHAPv2 methods have to be enabled with
`--enable-eap-md5` or `--enable-eap-mschapv2`, respectively.

== Configuration

In the xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] configuration file a
couple of important parameters have to been set:
----
charon {
  plugins {
    eap-ttls {
      max_message_count = 0
      # enable for certificate-based client authentication
      request_peer_auth = yes
      phase2_piggyback = yes
      phase2_method = md5
      phase2_tnc = yes
    }
    eap-tnc {
      max_message_count = 0
    }
    tnccs-20 {
      max_batch_size   = 32754
      max_message_size = 32722
    }
  }
}
----

=== Message Size Restrictions

Since often quite a lot of messages are exchanged via the PT-EAP transport protocol
protected by EAP-TTLS, the default upper limit set by the `*max_message_count*`
parameter of the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_eap_tnc[`*eap-tnc*`] and
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_eap_ttls[`*eap-ttls*`] plugins
have to be disabled in order not to disrupt the communication.

It is also recommended to set the maximum PB-TNC batch size and the maximum
PA-TNC message size possible with PT-EAP transport to the
xref:tnc/optimumTncSizes.adoc[optimum values] defined above.

=== Choice of EAP Authentication Method

If the EAP authentication is going to be based on X.509 client certificates then

 request_peer_auth = yes

must be set in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_eap_ttls[`*eap-ttls*`] plugin
subsection. Otherwise a PSK-based authentication takes place within the
established EAP-TTLS tunnel with the EAP method defined by

 phase2_method = md5

or alternatively

 phase2_method = mschapv2

TNC measurements transported via PT-EAP protected by the EAP-TTLS tunnel are
activated by

 phase2_tnc = yes

=== Initialization of TNC Database

In order for TNC measurements to be initiated and the ensuing TNC measurements
to be stored, the location of the TNC database and the path to the IMV policy
manager have to be configured in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_libimcv[`*libimcv*`] section of
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
----
libimcv {
  database = sqlite:///etc/pts/config.db
  policy_script = /usr/libexec/ipsec/imv_policy_manager
}
----
The TNC database is inititated with a strongSwan template in the following way
----
$ sudo -s
# mkdir /etc/pts
# cd /usr/share/strongswan/templates/database/imv
# cat tables.sql data.sql | sqlite3 /etc/pts/config.db
----
This means that the `*sqlite3*` command must be available on the TNC server
platform.

=== Restriction of TLS Cipher Suites

It is possible to restrict the TLS cipher suites accepted by the server
in a xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_libtls[`*libtls*`] section of
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
----
libtls
{
  suites = TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
}
----

xref:tnc/tncClient.adoc#_configuration[TNC Client] >

== Integrity Measurement Verifiers

Any number of Integrity Measurement Verifiers (IMVs) can be attached to a TNC Server.
An IMV is a dynamic library which communicates with the TNC Server via the
{IFIMV}[TNC IF-IMV] API defined in the form of a C header file. The `*/etc/tnc_config*`
file tells the TNC Server which IMVs are to be loaded:
----
#IMV-Configuration

IMV "OS"             /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imv-os.so
IMV "Scanner"        /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imv-scanner.so
# IMV "SWIMA"        /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imv-swima.so
# IMV "Attestation"  /usr/lib/ipsec/imcvs/imv-attestation.so
----
In the configuration file above, the `*OS IMV*` and the `*Scanner IMV*` are enabled, so
that these Integrity Measurement Verifiers have to be built beforehand with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] options

  --enable-imv-os --enable-imv-scanner

When the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon starts up, the IMVs are loaded.
In our example the IMV 1 `*OS*` and IMV 2 `*Scanner*` are enabled which subcribe to
the standard PA-TNC message subtypes `*Operating System*` and `*Firewall*` defined
in the `*IETF*` namespace, respectively.

== Certificate-Based EAP Client Authentication

Before the VPN server was started, the option

 charon.plugins.eap-ttls.request_peer_auth = yes

was set in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`].

=== IKEv2 Connection Setup

The VPN server receives an IKE_SA_INIT request from the VPN client with IP address
`*192.168.0.3*` and answers with an IKE_SA_INIT response

The VPN server receives the IKE_AUTH request without an AUTH payload from the VPN
client. Therefore the VPN server switches to EAP-based authentication and at the
outset requests an EAP Identity from the client. Due to the *EAP-only* mode
(proposed by the VPN client via the EAP_ONLY notify), the server doesn't include
an AUTH payload in its first IKE_AUTH response, either.

=== EAP-TTLS Tunnel Setup

The VPN server receives the first EAP-TTLS response which contains a Client Hello
message starting the TLS handshake. The negotiated TLS 1.2 cipher suite is
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`. The server then sends its TLS server
certificate and client certificate request

client. Therefore the VPN server switches to EAP-based authentication and at the

an AUTH payload in its first IKE_AUTH response, either.
